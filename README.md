# Overview

The goal of this project is to familiarize myself with data analysis using pandas. The
process includes reading, organizing, filtering, suming and visualizing data to produce
meaningful results. I hope to be more confident in data manipulation by the end of this 
project.

The data set I will be working on is called "Global_COVID_tracker". This data contains 
information on the administration of the covid-19 vaccines in different countries around the world. The data will be filtered to just the important information needed to complete this project.

The purpose for this software of to make it easier to access and track covid 19 updates around the world. The data was pulled from "Kaggle".

# Data Analysis Results

* What does the data table look like?
* What is the vaccination tracker results of a particular country?
* What are the top countries with doses administered?
* what are the top countries with the highest percentage population of fully vaccinated individuals?
* What are the top countries with the highest percentage of population with 1+ doses?
* What is the total number of doses administered?
* What does the graph plots look like?

# Development Environment

This project was completed using 'Pandas' for reading and data manipulation, and 'Mathplotlib' for data visualization.
The code for this project was written in 'Python' and the data was stored in a CSV file.

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html)
* [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

# Future Work
* Making the software more presentable
* I feel like there were a lot of repitition so I would like to work on that
* Asking more questions to better help narrow data
